<p>What the image is doing. <br> 

With the code presented the programmer has made the default picture 300px by 300px, and had the overflow hidden making the content invisible.<br> 
The default image is an image that is 300px by 300px, however there is hidden conent in the image.<br>
With the shrink class what it does is when the user hovers over the picture it makes the picture shrink.<br> 
The picture then transitions with with the user at 1 second and shows the full image.
